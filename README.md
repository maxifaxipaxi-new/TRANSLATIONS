# MFPSCRIPTS Translations
To contribute, fork the repository and make a new pull request with your changes. You can submit new locale files, or update an existing one with improvements.

Before contributing, you MUST read our guidelines here: https://docs.maxifaxipaxi.com/translations

Guidelines:

    The name of the locale file must be named with the language code, and be a lua file. For example en.lua, fr.lua, de.lua and so on.

    When creating a new locale file, simply copy an existing one (recommended to use English as it's the original file created by us), and replace the translations with the ones there.

    The start of the file must keep the variable declaration, and you must replace the existing language code to match the name of the file.

    Test the file before submitting your Pull Request to ensure that there are no syntax errors.

Feel free to add a credits comment to the top of the file with your name. Using the credits to advertise is not allowed.
